CONVENTION_GUIDE = """### STEP 1 — Hierarchical name reference (not about the component itself)?

The most common reason for NO_LINK: the sentence mentions the component name only
as part of a HIERARCHICAL/QUALIFIED NAME (dotted path, namespace, module path) that
refers to a nested sub-unit, not the component's own architectural role.

Software documentation commonly uses hierarchical naming (e.g., "X.utils", "X/handlers",
"X::impl") to refer to parts inside a component. The component name appears only as
a prefix, not as the subject.

Recognize these patterns — all are NO_LINK for component X:
- "X.utils provides helper functions" — dotted sub-unit reference
- "X.handlers, X.mappers, X.adapters follow a pipeline" — listing sub-packages of X
- "Classes in the X.impl package are not exported" — even with
  architectural language, if the subject is X's sub-unit → NO_LINK
- Bare name mixed with qualified paths: "X, Y.adapters, Y.transformers follow
  a pipeline design" — treat ALL as hierarchical references → NO_LINK

KEY DISTINCTION: Sentences that describe what X DOES or HOW X INTERACTS with other
components are LINK, even if they mention implementation details (e.g., "X uses Y
technology for Z" → LINK for X, because it describes X's behavior).

EXCEPTION: If the sentence also explicitly names the target component AS A PROPER
NOUN with the word "component" (e.g., "for the X component") → LINK.

Cross-reference rule: A sub-unit sentence mentioning a DIFFERENT component
in an architectural role is LINK for that other component.

### STEP 2 — Component name confused with a different entity?

**2a. Technology / methodology confusion:**

CRITICAL RULE: If a component IS NAMED AFTER a technology (e.g., the architecture
has a component called "Kafka Broker" or "Nginx Proxy" or "Zookeeper"), then ANY sentence
describing that technology's capabilities, role, or behavior IS about the component → LINK.
This rule applies because architecture components are often named after the technology they wrap.

NO_LINK ONLY when:
- The sentence describes a technology that is NOT one of our components
- The name appears in a compound entity unrelated to the component
  ("X Protocol specification" → NO_LINK for "X" if X is not about that protocol)
- Uses the name as part of a METHODOLOGY ("X testing in CI" → NO_LINK for "X")

LINK when:
- The technology IS one of our architecture components (always LINK)
- Components INTERACT with or connect THROUGH the technology

**2b. Generic word collision:**
NO_LINK — narrow, non-architectural sense:
- Process/activity modifier: "throttle X", "batch X", "polling X"
- Hardware/deployment: "a physical rack-mounted appliance", "multi-socket machine"
- Possessive/personal: "her bookmarks", "their account"

LINK — system-level architectural sense:
- System name + word: "the [System] gateway"
- Architectural role: "the orchestrator routes jobs to the gateway"

### STEP 3 — Default: LINK.
If neither Step 1 nor Step 2 applies → LINK.

### IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS:
- Multi-word component names (e.g., "Kafka Broker", "Nginx Proxy") are NEVER generic words → LINK
- CamelCase identifiers are NEVER generic words → LINK
- Sentences describing how components interact, connect, or communicate → LINK for ALL components involved (not just the grammatical subject). "X connects to Y" is LINK for both X and Y.
- Sentences about what a component does, provides, or handles → LINK
- A component does NOT need to be the grammatical subject to be relevant. If a sentence says "X sends data to Y", both X and Y get LINK.
- Only use NO_LINK when you are CONFIDENT the name is NOT used as a component reference

### Priority:
Be AGGRESSIVE with NO_LINK on sub-package descriptions (Step 1).
For Step 2, only NO_LINK when confident. Default to LINK."""


AMBIGUITY_FEW_SHOT = """
EXAMPLE 1:
NAMES: Lexer, Parser, CodeGenerator, Optimizer, Core, Util, AST, SymbolTable, Base
→ architectural: ["Lexer", "Parser", "CodeGenerator", "Optimizer", "AST", "SymbolTable"]
→ ambiguous: ["Core", "Util", "Base"]
Reasoning: Lexer/Parser/Optimizer name specific compilation roles. Core/Util/Base are
organizational labels that tell you nothing about what the component does.

EXAMPLE 2:
NAMES: Scheduler, Dispatcher, MemoryManager, Monitor, Pool, Helper, ProcessTable
→ architectural: ["Scheduler", "Dispatcher", "MemoryManager", "ProcessTable"]
→ ambiguous: ["Monitor", "Pool", "Helper"]
Reasoning: Scheduler/Dispatcher name specific OS roles. Monitor and Pool are ordinary
English words regularly used generically ("monitor performance", "thread pool").
Helper is an organizational label.

EXAMPLE 3:
NAMES: RenderEngine, SceneGraph, Pipeline, Layer, Proxy, Socket, Router
→ architectural: ["RenderEngine", "SceneGraph", "Socket", "Router"]
→ ambiguous: ["Pipeline", "Layer", "Proxy"]
Reasoning: RenderEngine/SceneGraph are CamelCase compounds — always architectural.
Socket/Router name specific networking roles. Pipeline/Layer/Proxy are ordinary words
used generically in documentation ("processing pipeline", "network layer", "behind a proxy").

EXAMPLE 4:
NAMES: PaymentGateway, OrderProcessor, Connector, Controller, Adapter, Worker, Agent
→ architectural: ["PaymentGateway", "OrderProcessor", "Worker"]
→ ambiguous: ["Connector", "Controller", "Adapter", "Agent"]
Reasoning: PaymentGateway/OrderProcessor are CamelCase compounds naming specific roles.
Worker names a specific concurrency mechanism. But Connector/Controller/Adapter/Agent
seem functional yet are GENERIC categories writers use without referring to any specific
component: "a database connector", "the main controller", "a protocol adapter", "a
background agent". They describe WHAT KIND of thing it is, not WHICH specific mechanism
— so they are ambiguous.""".strip()
