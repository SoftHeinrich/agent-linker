"""S5: All-Reject Guard — if judge rejects ALL but extraction found >= 3, use overrides only.

When the judge rejects every single mapping but the extraction found a reasonable
number (>= 3), the judge is likely being over-conservative. Discard the judge result
and let only the deterministic overrides (Fix A/B/C) decide.
Effect: Prevents 12% all-reject catastrophe. CamelCase synonyms always survive.

COMPONENTS: {', '.join(comp_names)}

WHAT TO FIND:
1. ABBREVIATIONS: Short forms explicitly introduced in the document.
   Rule: The abbreviation must be defined in the text, e.g., "Full Name (FN)" introduces FN.
   Like "Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)" defines AST — look for the same parenthetical pattern.

2. SYNONYMS: Alternative names that SPECIFICALLY refer to one component.
   Rule: The alternative name must unambiguously identify exactly ONE component.
   APPROVE: A proper name, role title, or technical alias used interchangeably with the component
   REJECT: A generic description that could apply to anything (like "the system" or "the process")

3. PARTIAL REFERENCES: A shorter form of a multi-word component name used alone.
   Rule: A trailing word from a multi-word name that, in this document, consistently means the full name.
   APPROVE: Only if the short form is unambiguous — no other component shares this word
   REJECT: Common words that have ordinary English meanings beyond the component

PROPOSED MAPPINGS:

Apply these rules:

REJECT if ANY of these are true:
- The term is used in its ordinary English sense, NOT as a name for the component
  (e.g., "the scheduler runs every minute" uses "scheduler" as a generic concept, not as a named component)
- The term refers to a different component or to the system as a whole
- The mapping cannot be verified from the actual document text

APPROVE if ALL of these are true:
- The term is used AS A NAME for the component in context (even if the word exists in a dictionary)
  (e.g., "The Dispatcher routes incoming requests" uses "Dispatcher" as a proper name for a specific component)
- The term appears in the document in a context that makes the reference clear
- The term unambiguously identifies exactly one component
