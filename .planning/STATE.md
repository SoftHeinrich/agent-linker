# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-31 for v2.1 kickoff)

**Core value:** Every rule removed from `s_linker13`/its prompts must hold macro F1 ≥ 0.93 on Claude Sonnet AND gpt-5.4 macro within ≤ 1pp of 0.9077 — or be rejected. Every retained prompt + helper must read as project-agnostic to a reviewer (GATE-06). Nothing currently runnable breaks.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — Scaffolding (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 10 of 4 (Scaffolding)
Plan: — of TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-31 — v2.1 roadmap created (Phases 10–13)

## Standing Gates (v2.1)

- GATE-01: macro F1 ≥ 0.93; BBB tolerance 6pp; other-dataset 2pp (Claude Sonnet)
- GATE-01 cross-model (v2.1 NEW): gpt-5.4 macro ≥ 0.9077 within ≤ 1pp tolerance (T to be committed in Phase 10)
- GATE-02 (v2.1 NEW): frozen-compat regression test; all CANONICAL_VARIANTS produce F1 matching v2.0 baseline JSON
- GATE-06: generality audit — every new prompt + helper passes BENCHMARK_TABOO scan AND reviewer-defensibility check
- GATE-07: every promoted variant registered in CANONICAL_VARIANTS + VARIANT_SPECS; standalone file; structured docstring

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v2.1 kickoff: `s_linker13.py`, `prompts_v2.py`, and existing helper modules are frozen; cleanup lands in `_clean` / `v3+` / `_min` siblings
- v2.1 kickoff: cross-model gate uses gpt-5.4 (v2.0 CROSS baseline 0.9077) with tolerance ≤ 1pp
- v2.1 kickoff: coarse granularity → 4 phases (10–13); sequential dependency chain

### Pending Todos

None yet. Next action: `/gsd-plan-phase 10`.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| v2.2+ | EXT-04: Emit-biased boundary prompting on alias-discovery (BBB variance ~3pp → ~1pp) | Deferred | v2.0 kickoff |
| v2.2+ | EXT-upstream: Upstream-tier rule removal (extraction/coref tier) | Deferred | v2.0 close |
| v2.2+ | ADAPTER-01: Multi-model backend-adaptive harness layer | Deferred | v2.0 close |
